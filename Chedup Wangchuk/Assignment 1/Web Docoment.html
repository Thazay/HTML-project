<ins>The Premier League,</ins> often referred to as the English Premier League or the EPL 
(legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited), is the top level 
of the English football league system. <q><mark> Contested by 20 clubs, it operates 
on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League</mark></q> (EFL).
 Seasons run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams
  both home and away).[1] Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.

		<big>The competition was founded</big> as the FA Premier League on <small>20 February 1992</small> following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888,<b> and take advantage </b>of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky.[2] From 2019-20, the league's accumulated television rights deals were worth around £3.1 billion a year,<strong> with Sky and BT Group</strong> securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games <i>respectively</i>.[3][4] The Premier League <em>is a corporation where</em> chief executive Richard Masters is responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders.[5] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to English Football League (EFL) clubs.

		<strike>The Premier League</strike>  is the most-watched sports league in the world, <del>broadcast,</del> in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[7][8] For the 2018–19 season average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181,[9] <u>second to the Bundesliga's</u> 43,500,[10] while aggregated <ins>attendance across all</ins> matches is the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981.[11] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[12] The Premier League ranks first in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons as of 2021.[13] The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of UEFA Champions League/European Cup titles, with five English clubs having won fourteen European trophies in total.

		Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Chelsea (5), Manchester City (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1) and Liverpool (1).

	<h2>History</h2>
	<hr>
	<a name="orgin"> <h3>Origins</h3> </a>
	<p>
		Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[15] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.
	</p>
	<p>
		By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, was published in January 1990.

	<p>
		During the 1980s major English clubs had begun to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[18] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in so doing they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[18] They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[19] and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[20][21] According to Scholar who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.[22] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a "super league", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.[20][23][24] The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of First Division with them instead of a smaller "super league".[25] By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrade as proposed by the Taylor Report.

	<h4>Foundation (1990s)</h4>
	<p>
		At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[31] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[16] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.
	</p>
	<p>
		The First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[16] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:
