		Homestays in Bhutan offer a unique 			
		experience to travelers visiting 
		the country and should be among the
		top things to do in Bhutan. The best
		way to explore and get the authentic
		cultural experience is by opting to 
		stay in one of the farmhouses which 
		offer homestay.  If you are the type 
		who is curious about how locals go about
		their daily lives, you would enjoy every 
		activity that you get to do and experience
		at a farm stay. And moreover spending a 
		night or two at a farmhouse offers an 
		authentic experience of the traditional 
		Bhutanese way of life.
