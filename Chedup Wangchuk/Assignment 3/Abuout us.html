	<h2><i>How it all beganâ€¦</i></h2>
	<p>
		Bhutan Homestay is a Bhutan based tour operator registered with the Tourism Council of Bhutan.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since opening its doors to tourism in 1974 an increasing number of travelers have visited the Kingdom of Bhutan. It is not uncommon for tourists to be herded from one attraction to another, getting a glimpse here and there with barely enough time to linger in one place. While that may work for large groups, there are also those who look for a different experience. They want to get closer to real Bhutanese people in their everyday lives. Additionally, families with small children need a lot of flexibility and standard itineraries are difficult to implement for them.
	</p>

		
	<p>
		We aim at showing our visitors the Bhutanese way of life in its natural environment, up close and as authentic as possible. Breaking away from mainstream tourism trends, Bhutan Homestay is committed to offering our clients an intimate, and once in a lifetime experience by including homestays and many personal encounters in our itineraries.
